These are some notes I have taken through my undergraduate study.

### LECTURE NOTE ON HOMOGENIZATION

(July 14, 2015)<br>
In summer 2015, while attending a summer course at the University of Science, Vietnam National University, HCMC, [Son P.T. Van](#http://sonv.github.io/) and I wrote lecture notes for this course. 

- **Topic:** *[Homogenization for viscosity solutions of Hamilton - Jacobi equations](@root/notes/summer2015.pdf)*

- **Instructor:** [Hung V. Tran](#http://www.math.wisc.edu/~hung/)


### UNDERGRADUATE THESIS

(May 31, 2015)<br>

- **Topic:** *Linear control systems and the regularity of the minimum time functions*

- **Advisor:** [Khai T. Nguyen](#https://tnguye13.math.ncsu.edu/)

- **Abstract:** Consider the linear control system $`x(t)=Ax(t)+Bu(t)`$ with the target $`0`$. The function $`T(x)`$ is the minimum time needed to steer a point $`x`$ to $`0`$. It is well-known that under the Rank-Kalman condition, $`T`$ is just continuous in the reachable set. Our main goal is to study the regularity of $`T(x)`$. We prove that $`T`$ is a.e. twice differentiable. Moreover, we also obtain an explicit formula for the set of singularities where the optimal control changes its sign.
