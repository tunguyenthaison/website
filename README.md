# Personal Website
---
This website is designed using [`Ivy`](http://www.dmulholl.com/docs/ivy/dev/index.html). Ivy is a minimalistic python static web generator. ALl contents are written in `Markdown` or [`Syntext`](http://www.dmulholl.com/docs/syntext/master/). 
The theme for this website is based on the build-in `graphite` theme that comes with `Ivy` with some modifications:

* Add support for Latex using `KaTex`, based on [`markdown_katex`](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-katex/).
* Modification of `.css` to support two-columns `div` and `collapsible-boxes`.
* Add blog page using [*Twenty Fifteen*](https://github.com/dmulholl/twentyfifteen) theme.
